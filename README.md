# ML Pipeline for Short-Term Rental Prices in NYC
This repo is one of the projects within Udacity ML DevOps Engineer Nanodegree. The objective of this project is to wrap up simple regression model for Rental prices predictions into [MLflow pipeline](https://mlflow.org) with experiment tracking via [Weights&Biases platform](https://wandb.ai). 

This repo is a filled up version of the [source repo](https://github.com/udacity/nd0821-c2-build-model-workflow-starter), which was shared by Udacity team as a starter code for the excersise. 

### Prerequisites

#### Create environment
Make sure to have conda installed and ready, then create a new environment using the ``environment.yml``
file provided in the root of the repository and activate it:

```bash
> conda env create -f environment.yml
> conda activate nyc_airbnb_dev
```

#### Get API key for Weights and Biases
Let's make sure we are logged in to Weights & Biases. Get your API key from W&B by going to 
[https://wandb.ai/authorize](https://wandb.ai/authorize) and click on the + icon (copy to clipboard), 
then paste your key into this command:

```bash
> wandb login [your API key]
```

You should see a message similar to:
```
wandb: Appending key for api.wandb.ai to your netrc file: /home/[your username]/.netrc
```


### The configuration
As usual, the parameters controlling the pipeline are defined in the ``config.yaml`` file. We are using Hydra to manage this configuration file. 
Open this file and get familiar with its content. This file is only read by the ``main.py`` script 
(i.e., the pipeline) and its content is
available with the ``go`` function in ``main.py`` as the ``config`` dictionary. For example,
the name of the project is contained in the ``project_name`` key under the ``main`` section in
the configuration file. It can be accessed from the ``go`` function as 
``config["main"]["project_name"]``.


### Running the entire pipeline or just a selection of steps
In order to run the pipeline when you are developing, you need to be in the root of the starter kit, 
then you can execute as usual:

```bash
>  mlflow run .
```
This will run the entire pipeline.

When developing it is useful to be able to run one step at the time. Say you want to run only
the ``download`` step. The `main.py` is written so that the steps are defined at the top of the file, in the 
``_steps`` list, and can be selected by using the `steps` parameter on the command line:

```bash
> mlflow run . -P steps=download
```
If you want to run the ``download`` and the ``basic_cleaning`` steps, you can similarly do:
```bash
> mlflow run . -P steps=download,basic_cleaning
```
You can override any other parameter in the configuration file using the Hydra syntax, by
providing it as a ``hydra_options`` parameter. For example, say that we want to set the parameter
modeling -> random_forest -> n_estimators to 10 and etl->min_price to 50:

```bash
> mlflow run . \
  -P steps=download,basic_cleaning \
  -P hydra_options="modeling.random_forest.n_estimators=10 etl.min_price=50"
```

### Train the model on a data sample

Currently, raw data is sourced from `components/get_data/data`. There are 2 samples available: `sample1.csv` and `sample2.csv`. Whenever you plan to run model with a fresh data extracted, put it into data folder and update ``config.yaml`` with corresponding file name under `etl:sample: new_file_name`. Alternatively, you can pass the file name through the CLI as following:

```bash
> mlflow run https://github.com/[your github username]/nd0821-c2-build-model-workflow-starter.git \
             -v [the version you want to use, like 1.0.0] \
             -P hydra_options="etl.sample=new_file_name"
```
